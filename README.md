# baby-town-frolics

A simple project for a groovy pcap parsing library that is highly configurable and easier to use than a wrapper around tshark/wireshark.

More details and instructions on how to use as functionality firms up.  

Sample pcap files are not included due to personal information, mac addresses, ips, ssids, etc being present.
